                    Where instead of making a simple todo app for your first project,
                    you made a highly complex glorified "to-Don't" web app with beautiful
                    design(i think) as a second big project.

                            This web app has user authentication(made by me!)!<br/> It uses passportjs with
                            bcrypt encryption and is stored in sqlite. It also has redirects users
                            that are not logged in, try clicking that to-Don't button up there or Dont.

                            This is a fullstack web app meaning that i(yes me) made both the backend and
                            the frontend. The backend uses a framework called express to handle all the
                            requests while frontend is handled by react.

                            Incase you didn't notice, this super-duper hard web app to make was made by me,
                            but i would also like to thank myself for helping me make this web app
                            (made by me), without me this wouldn't be possible.
