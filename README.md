# How It's Made:

**tech used:** React, React-icons, Express(Flash, Jwt, Session) Bcrypt, Better-sqlite3, Body-parser, Cors, ejs, JsonWebToken, Password(Jwt, Local)

## lesson Learned:

This project might sound easy and simple to make but during the making of it, i only started coding for 6 months. When i first thought of the project, i was a tad bit nervous as i only had i have done both backend and frontend but had never connected them both.

Basically the backend can be use to request data that cant be stored or process in the frontend like sessions and user authentication. Then, after we are done processing the data, it is send to the host.

The data is then sent to the frontend where it is displayed
